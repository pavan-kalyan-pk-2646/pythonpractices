Online Movie Ticket Booking System

The app represents an online platform (like BookMyShow) where users can browse Telugu movies and book tickets easily from one place.

Movie Information Display

Shows key details for each movie — name, ticket price, rating (U, UA, A), and available seats — helping users choose based on interest and availability.

Ticket Booking Process

Users select a movie, choose the number of tickets (up to 6), and confirm the booking.

The system automatically calculates the total cost, including GST (5%), and updates seat availability.

Age & Availability Restrictions

Implements realistic cinema rules:

“A” rated movies require age verification (must be 18+).

Prevents booking if seats are sold out or requested tickets exceed availability.

Booking Management & Summary

Keeps a booking history with details like movie name, tickets booked, and total amount.

Provides an option to reset all seats and view updated statistics such as total movies, tickets sold, and total revenue.
